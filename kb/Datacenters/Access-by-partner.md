# Access to Equinix IBX by partner

If a partner (for example a ISP who need to replace a router), needs access to an IBX they need to provide following infos : 

- First name of technician
- Last name of technician
- Phone number of technician
- Day of intervention

Then it's possible to create a access request on Equinix support portal containing previous infos and also a Letter Of Authorization (LOA).

After that Equinix give us a QR code for access that we need to transfer to the partner.
