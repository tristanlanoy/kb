Today, as I was booting up some old VMs on my PVE cluster, this occurred:

![Screenshot from the proxmox console during boot](https://mricher.fr/post/boot-from-an-efi-shell/efi-error.png)

The error reads `BdsDxe: failed to load Boot0001 "UEFI QEMU QEMU HARDDISK" from PciRoot(0x0/Pci(0x1E,0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x0)/Pci(0x5,0x0)/Scsi(0x0,0x0): Not Found`.

The VM then proceed to try to boot using PXE, fails, and eventually drop into an EFI shell:

![Screenshot of the EFI shell](https://mricher.fr/post/boot-from-an-efi-shell/efi-shell.png)

This particular VM is configured to boot using a `VirtIO SCSI` controller. The error was likely prompted by a change in the PCI bus or storage (virtual) card topology (^[1](https://mricher.fr/post/boot-from-an-efi-shell/#fn:1)^). The boot entry stored on the EFI NVRAM (persistent storage where the UEFI configuration is stored) didn't point anywhere, and the boot process failed flat.

> TODO: add a short walkthough explaining how to resolve this kind of error

Solution (temporary)
--------------------

> EDIT: This is a manual way of doing it, you can actually [use the UEFI menu to create a new entry](https://mricher.fr/post/boot-from-an-efi-shell/content/post/boot-from-an-efi-shell/index.en.md).

As in most shell, scrolling is `shift`+`pageUp`/`pageDown`. You can `exit` (leave the shell and exit to the EFI management interface) or `reboot`.

To load the disk and boot manually:

```
Shell>FS0:
FS0:\> ls
Directory of: FS0:\
09/22/2019 19:43 <DIR>  4,096 EFI
04/15/2020 20:51       10,668 NvVars
    1 File(s)   10,668 bytes
    1 Dir(s)
FS0:\> cd EFI
FS0:\EFI\> cd debian
FS0:\EFI\debian\> grub64.efi

```

EFI Shell Cheat-sheet
---------------------

The `map` command print the discovered partition and device mapping (akin `lsblk`), `vol <VOL-NAME>` print more details.

List boot options:

```
FS0:\> bcfg boot dump -b
...
Option: 06. Variable: Boot0004
  Desc    - UEFI QEMU HARDDISK QM00001
  DevPath - PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x1)/Ata(0x0)
  Optional- Y
...

```

Change boot order (shift down all other options)

```
# move option 6 to position 0, shifting down the others
FS0:\> bcfg boot mv 6 0

```

Remove an option

```
FS0:\> bcfg boot rm 4

```

Add an option

```
FS0:\> bcfg boot add 1 FS0:\EFI\GRUB\grubx64.efi "GRUB"
Target = 0007.
bcfg: Add Boot0007 as 1

```
